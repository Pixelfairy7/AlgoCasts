# AlgoCasts

This repo is a collection of my solutions to the algorithm problems presented in the Udemy Course by Stephen Grider. I will try to remember to add a walkthrough of my reasoning in an accompanying md file. 
Stephens solutions are available in the completed folder. 

## Tests 

This repo is configured to use Jest for testing. To use Jest. Make sure you have it installed:  npm install -g jest 

Then cd into the exercises folder.  

For example to run a test on the solution for reversestring you would in your terminal enter: jest reversestring/test.js --watch

This will execute the tests and in the terminal the output will advise if your tests passed or failed.
